# Key-Terms-Extraction
Extracting keywords can help you get to the text meaning. Also, It can help you with splitting texts into different categories. In this project, It will learn how to extract relevant words from a collection of news stories. There are many different ways to do it, but we will focus on frequencies, part-of-speech search, and TF-IDF methods. Note that each method can yield the results with varying degrees of accuracy for different texts. In reality, it is always good to try various methods and choose the best.
